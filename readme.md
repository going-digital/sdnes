#SDnes - an internal SD card modification for the Nintendo NES/SNES/Famicom/SuperFamicom classic consoles

This design is a mod-board that solders directly onto the PCB.

It is:
  * Cheap
  * Home solderable (although you will need a fine tip)
  * Compatible with Hakchi firmware
  * Tidy

It is:
  * NOT easy to solder. The minimal install requires soldering pads that are 1mm apart. If you are used to soldering surface mount, no problem. If not, this should not be your first project.
  * NOT as convenient as a ready-made board.

# Alternatives
  * [Super Storage](https://echo10.io) is a fully assembled board that allows much easier access.
  * SD breakout boards can be handwired.
  * For ultimate cheapness, an SD to microSD adapter makes a functional breakout board.
